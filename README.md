### Hi there, I'm [Arian Amani](https://ArianAmani.github.io)ðŸ‘‹

:speech_balloon: I'm a Computer Science student at the Sapienza University of Rome, studying, working on, and researching deep learning applications in Life Sciences such as Single-Cell Genomics and Drug Discovery with a focus on Generative Models as a remote research assistant at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. I'm also quite interested in Adversarial Examples and trying to make more robust and generalized deep learning models as well.
